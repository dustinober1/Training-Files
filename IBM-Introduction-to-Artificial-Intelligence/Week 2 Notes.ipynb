        "\n",
        "### Cognitive Computing (Perception, Learning, Reasoning)\n",
        "- Cognitive systems use processes similar to the decision-making process of humans to interpret and generate hypotheses about the information they read.\n",
        "- Cognitive systems rely on natural language governed by rules of grammar, context, and culture, to understand the real intent and context of the user's language. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Neural Networks\n",
        "\n",
        "### Terminology and Related Concepts\n",
        "- Programming all rules and moves of a game is not a true application of AI, rather training the machine to learn from data and enabling it figure out the moves and strategies for winning is how Machine Learning works. \n",
        "- Data Science is an interdisciplinary field encompassing the entire data processing methodology. \n",
        "  - While it uses AI techniques to derive insight from data, it is NOT a subset of AI.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Machine Learning\n",
        "- Machine learning uses computer algorithms to analyze large data sets to find common patterns and and define behavioral rules based on what it has learned.\n",
        "- Machine learning analyzes input data and answers to determine the set of rules and create the learning algorithm. \n",
        "- Unlike traditional algorithms which give answers based on predetermined set of rules, machine learning algorithms analyze input data and desired results to define behavioral rules based on which desired results can be achieved. \n",
        "  - The model can be continuously trained with new data sets. \n",
        "- Reinforcement learning relies on providing data and constraints and letting the model learn how to achieve desired results by trying different combinations of allowed actions, giving a reward or punishment depending on whether the decision was a good one. \n",
        "  - Reinforcement learning algorithms can teach a machine to play chess or even navigate an obstacle course. \n",
        "\n",
        "### Machine Learning Techniques and Training\n",
        "- Classification is the process of extracting features from data and classifying the results into one or more categories. \n",
        "- Classification focuses on results that have discrete values or class labels. \n",
        "  - Regression on the other hand works on estimating results that are continuous values.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Deep Learning\n",
        "- Neural networks are the reason deep learning algorithms can continuously learn on the job and improve the quality and accuracy of results as datasets increase in volume over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Neural Networks\n",
        "- Perceptrons are single-layered neural networks consisting of input nodes connected directly to an output node. \n",
        "  - Input layers forward the input values to the next layer, by means of multiplying by a weight and summing the results. \n",
        "  - An activation function determines how a node responds to its inputs and is a critical component to the success of a neural network.\n",
        "- This is an attribute of Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNs which are multilayer neural networks in which each layer conducts a mathematical operation, also known as a convolution, on the output of the previous layer. \n",
        "  - A perceptron only has a single layer.\n",
        "- Recurrent Neural Networks or RNNs are multi-layered neural networks that perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with prior outputs feeding subsequent stage inputs. \n",
        "  - RNNs make use of information in long sequences, each layer of the network representing the observation at a certain time.\n",
        "- Backpropagation uses a set of training data that match known inputs to desired outputs. \n",
        "  - The inputs are plugged into the network and outputs are determined. \n",
        "- Reward and punishment based on the decisions taken by a learning model are characteristic of Reinforcement Learning.\n",
        "- Backpropagation uses an error function to determine how far the given output is from the desired output, and over time, it makes adjustments in order to reduce the errors. \n",
        "- Backpropagation uses training datasets to match known inputs to desired outputs. Using an error function, it then determines how far the given output is from the desired output.\n",

        "## AI Application Areas\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Fields of Application in AI\n",
        "- Natural language is one of the most complex data for machine learning to work with. Natural language is highly contextualized, moreover humans view and use language conceptually rather than literally. Other types of data, be it auditory or visual data, have some form of discernible patterns, making it easier to work with than natural language.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Natural Language Processing, Speech, Computer Vision\n",
        "- Natural Language Processing uses machine learning and deep learning algorithms to deconstruct sentences grammatically, relationally, and structurally, to understand a word's semantic meaning and it's context of use. NLP systems are also able to understand intent and emotion, by drawing inferences through a broad array of linguistic models and algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Self Driving Cars\n",
        "- Self-driving vehicles fuse laser data, vision data, and radar data to create a three-dimensional view of their driving environment helping them make accurate decisions on the road.\n",
        "- Visual attention is a limitation of human vision that computer vision can help makeup for. Human vision cannot attend to everything in its visual field, all at the same time, like computer vision can.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hands-On Lab: Computer Vision \n",
        "\n",
        "### Lesson Summary\n",

        "\n",
        "- Speech-to-text enables machines to convert speech to text by identifying common patterns in the different pronunciations of a word, mapping new voice samples to corresponding words.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Speech Synthesis enables machines to create natural sounding voice models, including the voice of particular individuals.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Computer Vision enables machines to identify and differentiate objects in images the same way humans do.\n",

        "## Week 2 Quiz\n",
        "- Cognitive systems learn, adapt, and keep getting smarter by learning from their interactions with us and from their own successes and failures, just like humans do. \n",
        "- Deep Learning enables machines to continuously learn on the job and improve the quality and accuracy of results by determining whether decisions were correct.\n",
        "- Machine Learning uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions by defining behavioral rules based on what it has learned, without being explicitly programmed. These algorithms continue to learn on the job.\n",
        "- This statement is not an attribute of either Machine Learning or Unsupervised Learning. Machine Learning techniques such as unsupervised learning are not fed rules. Rather they determine the rules from data.\n",
        "- Supervised learning relies on giving the algorithm human-labeled data for training. The greater the number of samples that the algorithm is trained on, the greater is its precision in classifying new data. \n",
        "- Training data is used to train the algorithm. It is the Validation data that is used to  fine-tune algorithmâ€™s parameters and evaluate how good the model is.\n",
        "- Deep Learning algorithms rely on several layers of processing units, or neurons, where each layer passes on its output to the next layer, which processes it and passes it onto the next. The number of layers and the types of functions that connect the outputs of each layer to the inputs of the next are configured by developers.\n",
        "- Computer Vision enables machines to interpret digital images and video sequences and perform tasks like object identification.\n",
        "- Deconstructing sentences to decipher the context of use is a feature of Natural Language Processing, not Speech Synthesis.\n",
        "- AI learns in three different ways - Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning."
