[MUSIC] Can you tell us a little bit about the
work you're doing with self-driving cars. >> I've been working on self-driving
cars for the last few years. It's a domain that's exploded,
obviously, in interest since early competitions back
in the 2005 domain. And what we've been working on
really is putting together our own self-driving vehicle that was
able to drive on public roads in the regional Waterloo last August. With the self-driving cars area, one of our key research domains
is in 3D object detection. So this remains a challenging task for
algorithms to perform automatically. Trying to identify every vehicle,
every pedestrian, every sign that's in
a driving environment. So that the vehicle can make the correct
decisions about how it should move and interact with those vehicles. And so we work extensively on
how we take in laser data and vision data and radar data. And then fuse that into a complete
view of the world around the vehicle. >> When we think of computer vision, we usually think immediately of
self-driving cars, and why is that? Well, it's because it's hard to pay
attention when driving on the road, right? You can't both be looking
at your smartphone and also be looking at
the road at the same time. Of course, it's sometimes hard to predict
what people are going to be doing on the street, as well. When they're crossing the street with
their bike or skateboard, or whatnot. So it's great when we have some sort
of camera or sensor that can help us detect these things and prevent accidents
before they could potentially occur. And that's one of the limitations of human
vision, is attention, is visual attention. So I could be looking at you, Rav, but behind you could be this
delicious slice of pizza. But I can only pay attention to one or just some limited number
of things at a time. But I can't attend to everything in my
visual field all at once at the same time like a camera could. Or like how computer vision
could potentially do so. And so that's one of the great things that
cameras and computer vision is good for. Helping us pay attention to the whole
world around us without having us to look around and make sure that we're
paying attention to everything. And that's just in self-driving cars, so I
think we all kind of have a good sense of how AI and computer vision shapes
the driving and transportation industry. >> Well, self-driving cars
are certainly the future. And there's tremendous interest
right now in self-driving vehicles. In part because of their
potential to really change the way our society works and operates. I'm very excited about being able
to get into a self-driving car and read or
sit on the phone on the way to work. Instead of having to pilot
through Toronto traffic. So I think they represent a really
exciting step forward, but there's still lots to do. We still have lots of interesting challenges to solve
in the self-driving space. Before we have really robust and safe cars that are able to drive themselves 100%
of the time autonomously on our roads. >> We've just launched our own
self-driving car specialization on Coursera. And we'd be really happy to see students
in this specialization also come and learn more about self-driving. It's a wonderful starting point,
it gives you a really nice perspective on the different components of
the self-driving software stack and how it actually works. So everywhere from how it perceives the
environment, how it makes decisions and plans its way through that environment. To how it controls the vehicle and
makes sure it executes those plans safely. So you'll get a nice broad sweep of all
of those things from that specialization. And from there you then
want to become really good and really deep in one particular area,
if you want to work in this domain. Because again, there's so
many layers behind this. There's so much foundational knowledge
you need to start contributing that you can't go wrong. If you find something interesting,
just go after it. And I am sure there'll be companies
that'll need you for this. [MUSIC](Music) Some of the most common application areas
of AI include natural language processing, speech, and computer vision.
Now, let's look at each of these in turn. Humans have the most advanced method of
communication which is known as natural language. While humans can use computers to send
voice and text messages to each other, computers do not innately
know how to process natural language. Natural language processing is a subset of
artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand the meaning of human
language. Natural language processing uses machine learning
and deep learning algorithms to
discern a word's semantic meaning. It does this by deconstructing sentences grammatically,
relationally, and structurally and understanding the context of use.
For instance, based on the context of a conversation, NLP can determine if the word
"Cloud" is a reference to cloud computing or the mass of
condensed water vapor floating in the sky. NLP systems might also be able
to understand intent and emotion, such as whether you're asking a question out
of frustration, confusion, or irritation.
Understanding the real intent of the user's language,
NLP systems draw inferences through a broad array of linguistic models and algorithms.
Natural language processing is broken down into
many subcategories related to audio and visual tasks.
For computers to communicate in natural language, they need to be able to convert speech into
text, so communication is more natural and easy
to process. They also need to be able to convert text-to-speech,
so users can interact with computers without the requirement to stare at a screen.
The older iterations of speech-to-text technology require programmers to go
through tedious process of discovering and codifying
the rules of classifying and converting voice samples into text.
With neural networks, instead of coding the rules,
you provide voice samples and their corresponding text.
The neural network finds the common patterns among the pronunciation
of words and then learns to map
new voice recordings to their corresponding texts.
These advances in speech-to-text technology are the reason we have real time transcription.
Google uses AI-powered speech-to-text in there Call Screen feature to
handle scam calls and show you the text of the person speaking in real time.
YouTube uses this to provide automatic closed captioning.
The flip side of speech-to-text is text-to-speech also known as speech synthesis.
In the past, the creation of a voice model required hundreds of hours of
coding. Now, with the help of neural networks,
synthesizing human voice has become possible. First, a neural network ingests numerous samples
of a person's voice until it can tell whether
a new voice sample belongs to the same person. Then, a second neural network
generates audio data and runs it through the first network to see if it
validates it as belonging to the subject. If it does not, the generator corrects
its sample and reruns it through the classifier. The two networks repeat the process
until they generate samples that sound natural. Companies use AI-powered voice synthesis to
enhance customer experience and give their
brands their unique voice. In the medical field,
this technology is helping ALS patients regain their true voice instead of using a computerized
voice. The field of computer vision focuses on
replicating parts of the complexity of the human visual system,
and enabling computers to identify and process objects in images and videos,
in the same way humans do. Computer vision is one of the technologies
that enables the digital world to interact with the physical
world. The field of computer vision has
taken great leaps in recent years and surpasses humans in tasks related
to detecting and labeling objects, thanks to advances in deep learning and neural
networks. This technology enables self-driving cars
to make sense of their surroundings. It plays a vital role in
facial recognition applications allowing computers to match images of
people's faces to their identities. It also plays a crucial role
in augmented and mixed reality. The technology that allows
computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, and smart glasses to overlay and embed
virtual objects on real-world imagery. Online photo libraries like Google Photos,
use computer vision to detect objects and classify images by the type of content they
contain. (Music)(Music) An artificial neural network is a collection of smaller
units called neurons, which are computing
units modeled on the way the human brain
processes information. Artificial neural networks borrow some ideas from the biological neural network of the brain, in order to approximate some
of its processing results. These units or neurons
take incoming data like the biological neural networks and learn to make
decisions over time. Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation. Backpropagation uses a set
of training data that match known inputs
to desired outputs. First, the inputs are plugged into the network and
outputs are determined. Then, an error function
determines how far the given output is from
the desired output. Finally, adjustments are made
in order to reduce errors. A collection of neurons
is called a layer, and a layer takes in an input
and provides an output. Any neural network will have one input layer and
one output layer. It will also have
one or more hidden layers which simulate the types of activity that goes on in the human brain. Hidden layers take in
a set of weighted inputs and produce an output through
an activation function. A neural network having more than one hidden layer is referred to as
a deep neural network. Perceptrons are the simplest and oldest types of
neural networks. They are single-layered
neural networks consisting of input nodes connected
directly to an output node. Input layers forward the input
values to the next layer, by means of multiplying by a weight and summing the results. Hidden layers receive
input from other nodes and forward their output
to other nodes. Hidden and output nodes have
a property called bias, which is a special type
of weight that applies to a node after the other inputs
are considered. Finally, an activation function determines how a node
responds to its inputs. The function is run against the sum of the inputs and bias, and then the result is
forwarded as an output. Activation functions can
take different forms, and choosing them is
a critical component to the success of
a neural network. Convolutional neural
networks or CNNs are multilayer neural
networks that take inspiration from
the animal visual cortex. CNNs are useful in applications
such as image processing, video recognition, and
natural language processing. A convolution is
a mathematical operation, where a function is applied
to another function and the result is a mixture
of the two functions. Convolutions are
good at detecting simple structures in an image, and putting those simple features together to construct
more complex features. In a convolutional network, this process occurs over
a series of layers, each of which conducts a convolution on the output
of the previous layer. CNNs are adept at building complex features from
less complex ones. Recurrent neural
networks or RNNs, are recurrent
because they perform the same task for
every element of a sequence, with prior outputs feeding
subsequent stage inputs. In a general neural network, an input is processed through a number of layers
and an output is produced with an assumption that the two successive inputs are
independent of each other, but that may not hold true
in certain scenarios. For example, when
we need to consider the context in which
a word has been spoken, in such scenarios, dependence on previous observations has to be considered to
produce the output. RNNs can make use of
information in long sequences, each layer of
the network representing the observation at
a certain time. (Music)(Music) So can you talk about the different areas or categories of
artificial intelligence? Now, there are lots of different
fields that AI works in. But if I were to on a very very high level
group some of the major areas where artificial
intelligence is applied, I'd like to start off
with natural language. Because natural language is, I'd say, the most complex data for machine learning
to work with. If you see all sorts of data, whether that be
a sequence to genome, whether that be audio, whether that be images. There's some sort of
discernible pattern. There's some sort of yes, this is what a car
sounds like or yes, this is what human voice
sounds like. But natural language
is fundamentally, a very human task. It's very human data source. We as humans invented it
for humans to understand. If I were to, for example, give you a book title, there's actually a very very famous book, and the title of
the book is there are two mistakes in
the the title of this book. Now, there's actually
only one mistake, the two the's. The human brain
doesn't realize that. What's the second mistake? That there was only one mistake. So this is a sort of
natural language complexity that's involved here. Humans we don't view
natural language literally. We view it conceptually. If I were to write a
three instead of an E, you will understand
it because we don't mean the three in
a literal sense. We mean that in a symbolic sense
to represent the concept of E and you can contextualize that three
to figure out that, "Yeah. It means in E" and
not an actual three. These are things that
computers aren't capable of. So natural languages that number one field that I'm most interested in when it
comes to machine learning. Second, I'd say the most
popular would be visual. Visual data understanding,
computer vision. Because it enables us
to do so many things. As humans, our primary
sense is vision. In fact, a vast majority of your brain's processing power
at any given moment, goes to understanding what
it is that you're seeing. Whether it be a person's face, or whether it be
a computer or some texts, or anything of that sort. Third, I would say
audio-based data. So text-to-speech, speech-to-text these
are very very complex. The reason it's
complex is because it combines a lot of
challenges into one. First of all, you've got
to support many languages. You can't just support
English and call it a day. You've got to support
other languages. You've got to support
other demographics. Another challenge is that
even within languages, there are absolutely
infinite number of ways that any human
could represent a language. Everyone's going to have
a different accent. Everyone's going to have a different way of
pronouncing certain words. There's no standardized way
that every human will pronounce ice cube exactly like ice cube. That
doesn't exist. If you take a look at
another challenge, it's that audio data is fundamentally very very
difficult to work with. Because the thing is, audio data exists in the natural world.
What is audio? It's vibrations of air molecules, and vibrations of
air molecules are fast. Audio is recorded at
overpay say 44 kilohertz. That's a lot of data, 44,000 data points
every single second. There are usually only
44,000 data points in an individual
low-resolution image. So of course, there are lots of challenges to work around
when it comes to audio. But companies like IBM, Google, Microsoft have
actually worked around these challenges
and they're working towards creating
different services to make it easier for developers. So again, on
a very very high level, there's natural
language understanding, there's computer vision, there's audio data and of course, there's the traditional set of tabular data understanding. Which is essentially,
structured data understanding. (Music)[MUSIC] Can you tell us a little bit about the

information in long sequences, each layer of
the network representing the observation at
a certain time. (Music)(Music) Machine Learning is a broad field and we
can split it up into three different categories, Supervised Learning,
Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. There are many different tasks we can solve
with these. Supervised Learning refers to
when we have class labels in the dataset and we use these
to build the classification model. What this means is when we receive data,
it has labels that say what the data represents. In a previous example,
we had a table with labels such as age or sex.
With Unsupervised Learning, we don't have class labels
and we must discover class labels from unstructured data.
This could involve things such as deep learning looking at pictures to train
models. Things like this are typically done
with something called clustering. Reinforcement Learning is a different subset,
and what this does is it uses a reward function to
penalize bad actions or reward good actions. Breaking down Supervised Learning,
we can split it up into three categories, Regression, Classification and Neural Networks.
Regression models are built by looking at the relationships between
features x and the result y where y is a continuous variable.
Essentially, Regression estimates continuous values.
Neural Networks refer to structures that imitate the structure of the human brain.
Classification on the other hand, focuses on discrete values it identifies.
We can assign discrete class labels y based on many input features x.
In a previous example, given a set of features x,
like beats per minute, body mass index, age and sex,
the algorithm classifies the output y as two categories, True or False,
predicting whether the heart will fail or not.
In other Classification models, we can classify results into more than two
categories. For example, predicting whether
a recipe is for an Indian, Chinese, Japanese, or Thai dish.
Some forms of classification include decision trees,
support vector machines, logistic regression, and random forests.
With Classification, we can extract features from the data.
The features in this example would be beats per minute or age.
Features are distinctive properties of input patterns that
help in determining the output categories or classes of output.
Each column is a feature and each row is a data point.
Classification is the process of predicting the class of given data points.
Our classifier uses some training data to understand
how given input variables relate to that class. What exactly do we mean by training?
Training refers to using a learning algorithm to determine
and develop the parameters of your model. While there are many algorithms
to do this, in layman's terms, if you're training a model to
predict whether the heart will fail or not, that is True or False values,
you will be showing the algorithm some real-life data labeled True,
then showing the algorithm again, some data labeled False,
and you will be repeating this process with data having True or False values,
that is whether the heart actually failed or not.
The algorithm modifies internal values until it has learned to tell from
data that indicates heart failure that is True or not, that is False.
With Machine Learning, we typically take a dataset and split it into three sets,
Training, Validation and Test sets. The Training subset is
the data used to train the algorithm. The Validation subset is used to validate
our results and fine-tune the algorithm's parameters.
The Testing data is the data the model has never seen
before and used to evaluate how good our model is.
We can then indicate how good the model is using terms like,
accuracy, precision and recall.[MUSIC] Welcome to exploring AI and ethics. In this video, you will learn about
what AI ethics is, and why it matters. You will find out, what makes AI
ethics a socio-technical challenge, what it means to build and
use AI ethically, and how organizations can
put AI ethics into action. AI, Artificial Intelligence, is
a very pervasive in everybody's life. Even if often we don't realize it,
we use it when we use a credit card to buy something online,
when we search something on a web, when we post or like or
follow somebody on a social platform. And even when we drive with
the navigation support, and the driver assistance capabilities
of the car based on AI. This pervasiveness generates very fast
a significant transformations in our life, and also in the structure and
equilibrium of our society. This is why AI besides being
a technical and scientific discipline, has also a very significant social impact. This raises a lot of ethical questions
about how AI should be designed, developed, deployed,
used, and also regulated. The social technical dimensions of
AI requires efforts to identify all stakeholders,
that go well beyond technical experts, and include also sociologists,
philosophers, economists, policymakers. And all the communities that are impacted
by the deployment of this technology. Inclusiveness is necessary
in defining the ecosystem, in all the phases of the AI
development and deployment, and also in the impact of AI
in the deployment scenario. Without it,
we risk of creating AI only for some, and leave many others behind
in a disadvantaged position. Everybody needs to be involved in
defining the vision of the future that we want to build using AI and other
technology as a means and not as an end. To achieve this, appropriate guidelines
are necessary to drive the creation and use of AI in the right direction. Technical tools are necessary and useful,
but they should be complemented by principles guardrails, well-defined
processes, and effective governance. We should not think that all
these slows down innovation. Think about traffic rules,
it may seem that traffic lights, precedents, and stop signals, and
speed limits are slowing us down. However, without them,
we will not drive faster, but actually we would drive much slower,
because we would be always in a complete state of uncertainty about
other vehicles and pedestrians. AI ethics identifies and addresses the socio-technical
issues raised by this technology, and makes sure that the right
kind of innovation is supported, and facilitated, so that the path
to the future we want is faster. As our CEO at IBM States, "Trust
is our license to operate." We've earned this trust through
our policies, programs, partnerships and advocacy of
the responsible use of technology. For over 100 years,
IBM has been at the forefront of innovation that brings benefits
to our clients and society. This approach most definitely
applies to the development, use, and deployment of AI. Therefore, ethics should be embedded
into the lifecycle of the design and development process. Ethical decision making is not just
a technical problem solving approach. Rather an ethical,
sociological, technical and human centered approach,
should be embarked upon, based on principles, value standards,
laws and benefits to society. So having this foundation is important,
even necessary, but where to start? A good place to start is with
a set of guiding principles, at IBM we call our principles,
the principles of trust and transparency. of which there are three. The purpose of AI is to augment
not replace human intelligence. Data and
insights belong to their creator and new technology including AI systems
must be transparent and explainable. This last principle is built upon our
pillars, of which there are five. We just mentioned transparency
which reinforces trust, by sharing the what, and the how,
the AI is being used for. It must be explainable and also fair. So when it's properly calibrated,
it can assist in making better choices. Should be robust,
which means it should be secure, and as well as privacy preserving,
safeguarding privacy and rights. We know having principles and
pillars are not enough. We have an extensive set of tools and
talented practitioners that can help diagnose, monitor, promote all of our
pillars and continuous monitoring, to mitigate against drift and
unintended consequences. The first step to putting AI ethics
into action, just like with anything else, is about building
understanding and awareness. This is about equipping your teams to
think about AI ethics, what it means to put it into action, whatever
solution you're building and deploying. Let's take an example,
if you're building a learning solution and deploying that within a company, your HR team leader who is doing
that should be thinking about, is this solution designed
with users in mind? Have you co-created
the solution with users? How does it enable equal
access to opportunity to all the employees across diverse groups. A keen understanding of AI ethics, and reflecting on these issues continuously, is critical as a foundation to
putting AI ethics into action. The second step in putting
AI ethics into action, once you build that understanding and
awareness and everybody is reflecting on this topic, is
to put in place in a governance structure. And the critical point here is, it's a governance structure
to scale AI ethics in action. It's not about doing it in one
isolated instance in a market, or in a business unit, it's about a
governance structure that works at scale. We talked about understanding and
awareness as a foundation, second governance, which is the responsibility
of leaders to put in place structures. Once you've got these two elements,
the third step is operationaIizing. How do you make sure a developer,
or a data scientist, or a vendor, who's in Malaysia or Poland knows
how to put AI ethics into action? What does it mean for them? Right? It's one thing to put structures
in place at the global level, but how do you make sure it's operationalized
at scale in the markets and every user, every data scientist, every
developer knows what they need to do? This is all about having clarity of
the pillars of trustworthy AI for IBM, it is transparency. Let's go back to our learning example,
are you designing it with users? Think about, what we think of as best in
class, transparent recommendation systems, your favorite movie streaming service,
or your cab hailing service? It's transparent, is it explainable? Is it telling you what recommendations
are, and why they're being made, but also telling you as a user, it's your
choice to make the final decision? Fairness, is it giving equal access to
opportunity to everyone by ensuring adoption, not just of the process, but
also the outcome across different groups. Robustness, privacy,
every data scientist and developer and every vendor needs to know, what we mean
by these in a very operational manner. [MUSIC]Welcome to exploring today's AI concerns. In this video, you will learn about
some of today's hot topics in AI. First, you will hear about why
trustworthy AI is the hot topic in AI. Then, you will hear about how AI is
used in facial recognition technologies, in hiring in marketing on social media and
in healthcare. People frequently ask me what
our current hot topics in AI and I will tell you that whatever I answer
today is likely to be different next week or even by tomorrow. The world of AI is extremely dynamic,
which is a good thing. It's an emerging technology with
an amazing amount of possibilities and the potential to solve so
many problems, so much faster than what we
thought was before possible. Now, as we've seen in some cases
it can have harmful consequences. And so, I would say that the hot topic
in AI is how do we do this responsibly? And IBM has come up with five
pillars to address this issue, kind of summarizing
the idea of responsible AI. That is explain ability, transparency,
robustness, privacy and fairness. And we can go into those
topics in more depth, but I want to emphasize two things here and one is that this is not a one and
done sport. If you're going to use AI, if we're
going to put it into use in society, this is not something you just address
at the beginning or at the end. This is something you have to address
throughout the entire lifecycle of AI. These are questions you have to ask
whether you're at the drawing board, whether you're designing the AI,
you're training the AI or you have put it into use or you are the
end user who's interacting with the AI. And so, those five pillars or things you want to constantly think about
throughout the entire lifecycle of AI. And then second and I think even more
importantly is this is a team sport, we all need to be aware of
both the potential good and the potential harm that comes from AI. And encourage everybody to ask questions. Make room for people to be curious
about how AI works and what it's doing. And with that I think we can really
use it to address good problems and have some great results and
mitigate any of the potential harm. So stay curious. In designing solutions around
Artificial Intelligence, call it AI, facial recognition has
become a permanent use case. There are really three typical
examples of categories of models and algorithms that are being designed.
Facial detection that is simply detecting whether it is
a human face versus a or a dog or cat. This type of facial recognition happens
without uniquely identifying who that face might belong to. In facial authentication,
you might use this type of facial recognition to open up your iPhone or
your android device. In this case, we provide a
one-on-one authentication by comparing the features of a face image. What they previously stored, single up
image, meaning that you are really only comparing the images with the distinct
image of the owner of the iPhone or android device. Facial matching, in this case, we compare the image with
a database of other images or photos. Just as different from the previous
in that, the model is trying to determine a facial match of
an individual against the database for images below it or
photos belonging to other humans. There are many different
examples of facial recognition. Many of them you have no doubt
experienced in your day to day activity. Some have proven to be helpful while
others have shown to be not so helpful and then there are others that have proven
to be direct criminal in nature. Where certain demographics of people have
been harmed because of the use of these facial recognition systems. We've seen facial recognitions and
solutions in AI systems provide significant value in scenarios
like navigating through an airport or going through security or security align. Or even using previous previous
examples like the one we talked about earlier where facial
recognition to unlock your iPhone or possibly to unlock your home or
down lock the door in your automobile. These are all helpful uses of
facial recognition technologies but there are also some clear examples and
use cases that must be off-limits. These might include identifying a person
and the crowd without the sole permission of that person or doing mass surveillance
on a single or group of people. These types of uses of technology
raises important privacy, civil rights, and human rights concerns. When used the wrong way by the wrong
people in facial recognition technologies no doubt can be
used to suppress, dissent, or infringe upon the rights of minorities or to simply just erase your basic
expectations of having privacy. AI is being increasingly introduced
into each stage of workforce progression, hiring,
onboarding, career progression, including promotions and
awards handling, attrition etc. Stock board hiring: Consider an organization that receives
thousands of job applications. People applying for
all kinds of jobs, front office, back office, seasonal, permanent. Instead of having large
teams of people sit and sift through all these applications,
AI helps you rank and prioritize applicants against
targeted job openings, presenting a list of the top
candidates to the hiring managers. AI solutions can process
text in resumes and combine that with other structured
data to help in decision making. Now, we need to be careful
to have guardrails in place. We need to ensure the use of AI
in hiring is not biased across sensitive attributes like age,
general ethnicity and the like. Even when those attributes are not
directly used by the AI but maybe creeping in, coming in from
proxy attributes like zip code or type of job previously held. One of the hot topics in AI
today is its application and marketing on social media. It has completely transformed
how brands interact with their audiences on
social media platforms like TikTok, LinkedIn,
Twitter, Instagram, Facebook. AI today can create ads for you,
it can create social media posts for you. It can help you target
those ads appropriately. It can use sentiment analysis to
identify new audiences for you. All of this drives incredible results for
a marketeer. It improves the effectiveness of
the marketing campaigns while dramatically reducing the cost of
running those campaigns. Now, the same techniques and
capabilities that AI produces for doing marketing on social media platforms
also raises some ethical questions. The marketing is successful
because of all of the data and social media platforms
collect from their users. Ostensibly, this data is
collected to deliver more personalized experiences for end users. It's not always explicit what
data is being collected and if you are providing your consent for
them to use as data. Now, the same techniques that are so
effective for marketing campaigns for
brands can also be applied for generating misinformation,
conspiracy theories. Whether it's political or
scientific misinformation and this has horrendous implications for
our communities at large. This is why it is absolutely
critical that all enterprises adhere to some clear principles
around transparency, explain ability, trust,
privacy in terms of how they use AI or build AI into their solutions
into their platforms. The use of AI is increasing
across all healthcare segments, healthcare providers,
pairs, life sciences etc. Pair organizations are using AI and machine learning solutions
that tap into claims data, often combining it with other data sets
like social determinants of health. A top use case is disease prediction for
coordinating care. For example, predicting who in
the member population is likely to have an adverse condition, maybe like
an ER visit in the next three months and then providing the right forms
of intervention and prevention. Equitable care becomes very
important in this context. We need to make sure the AI is not biased
across sensitive attributes like age, gender, ethnicity, etc. Across all of these of course,
conversational AI where virtual agents as well as systems that help humans
better service the member population. That has become table stakes. Across all of these use cases of AI in
health care, we see a few common things. Being able to unlock insights from the
rich sets of data the organization owns, improving the member or
patient experience, and having guardrails in place to
ensure AI is trustworthy. [MUSIC][MUSIC] While Machine Learning is a subset
of Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning is a specialized
subset of Machine Learning. Deep Learning layers algorithms
to create a Neural Network, an artificial replication of the structure
and functionality of the brain, enabling AI systems to continuously learn
on the job and improve the quality and accuracy of results. This is what enables these systems to
learn from unstructured data such as photos, videos, and audio files. Deep Learning, for example, enables natural language understanding
capabilities of AI systems, and allows them to work out the context
and intent of what is being conveyed. Deep learning algorithms do not
directly map input to output. Instead, they rely on several
layers of processing units. Each layer passes its output to
the next layer, which processes it and passes it to the next. The many layers is why
it’s called deep learning. When creating deep learning algorithms,
developers and engineers configure the number of layers
and the type of functions that connect the outputs of each layer
to the inputs of the next. Then they train the model by providing
it with lots of annotated examples. For instance, you give a deep learning
algorithm thousands of images and labels that correspond to
the content of each image. The algorithm will run the those examples
through its layered neural network, and adjust the weights of the variables
in each layer of the neural network to be able to detect the common patterns that
define the images with similar labels. Deep Learning fixes one of
the major problems present in older generations of learning algorithms. While the efficiency and performance of machine learning
algorithms plateau as the datasets grow, deep learning algorithms continue to
improve as they are fed more data. Deep Learning has proven to be
very efficient at various tasks, including image captioning,
voice recognition and transcription, facial recognition, medical imaging,
and language translation. Deep Learning is also one of the main
components of driverless cars. [MUSIC][MUSIC] Can you talk about some of
the applications of AI? >> There's all kind of different
applications, obviously, there's healthcare, there's finance. The one that's closest to my heart,
of course, is robotics and automation. Where the AI technologies really help
us to improve our abilities to perceive the environment around the robot and to make plans in unpredictable
environments as they're changing. >> There's a great book out by an author,
it was Kelvin Kelly, and he is an editor for the Wired magazine,
he's written a great book about technologies that are going to
be changing shaping our world, specifically 12 technologies. And he's got a fantastic definition in the
book about specifically how AI is going to permeate our everyday life and it's
all summarized in one excellent quote. So he says that the business cases for the next 10,000 startups
are easy to predict, I have x and I will add AI to my x. The way I understand that
is it's basically a notion that AI in one shape, way or
form, in any shape or form, is going to permeate every
aspect of human endeavor. Everything we do, everything we
touch is going to be enhanced by AI. We have great benefits from taking
any device, any machine, and make it just a little bit smarter. The benefit of that is just
adding a bit of smarts to it, a bit of intelligence to it is
exponential in its benefit. >> So we work a lot with some
really fun applications of AI. We do a couple of different
things in the lab that I run. We work on self-driving vehicles as one
aspect, so autonomy for self-driving. Which requires a lot of AI for
the vision systems, for the navigational intelligence, for the planning and
control aspects of the car, we do that. And we also have a large research program
in what are called collaborative robotics, or cobots. So robots that are designed to work in and
around and with people. And that presents a lot of challenges,
because we want the robots to act intelligently and to interface
with humans in a way that is natural. And that requires understanding how people
behave, which requires intelligence. In addition to those,
there are a myriad of other applications, drug discovery, medical treatments for
cancer and other diseases. So a bunch of extremely
exciting applications. >> I mean I think the general use of AI so far has been taking large data sets,
and making sense of them. And doing some sort of processing
with that data in real time. That's what we've been doing, and that's what we've seen most effective,
in terms of creating some sort of larger scale impact in healthcare
beyond just having a siloed device. And we've been seeing
that across the board, across the whole healthcare spectrum. >> We use AI all the time, and a lot of
the times we're not even aware of it. We use AI every time we type in
a search query on a search engine, every time we use our GPS. Or every time we use some kind
of voice recognition system. >> I like to focus on
a particular segment of AI, if that's okay, around computer vision. Because it's just particularly
fascinating to me. Now, when we think of computer vision,
they're looking at AI in ways to help augment, or to help automate or to help
train computers to do something that's already very difficult
to train humans to do. Like when it comes to the airport,
trying to find weapons within luggage through the X-ray scanner,
now that could be difficult to do. No matter how much you train someone
that can be very difficult to identify. But with computer vision that can
help to automate, help to augment, help to flag, certain X-ray images so
that maybe even humans can just take a look at a filtered set of images,
not all of the images right? So computer vision is very disruptive. And so there's many ways in which computer
vision can really help to augment the capabilities of humans in
lots of different industries. >> Now I mean applications of
AI are really all around us. There's no limit to really what we're
doing with artificial intelligence. When you do practically anything on any
technology, you're most probably using some form of what we call machine
learning or artificial intelligence. For example, when you check your email. Doing something as simple
as checking your email. Spam filtering has been done for
years with machine learning technology. More recently, Google came out with their features that
enable you to do smart email compositions. So you can actually have text written for you on the fly as you're
writing your email. Your subjects are automatically written
as well, it'll recommend to you who you should be sending the email to,
see if you missed someone. All of these things are powered
by machine learning. But some of the main areas where I believe
machine learning technology can make an impact are the fields of
health care and education. [MUSIC]Welcome to Defining AI Ethics. Humans rely on culturally agreed-upon morals
and standards of action — or ethics — to guide their decision-making, especially for
decisions that impact others. As AI is increasingly used to automate and
augment decision-making, it is critical that AI is built with ethics at the core so its
outcomes align with human ethics and expectations. AI ethics is a multidisciplinary field that
investigates how to maximize AI's beneficial impacts while reducing risks and adverse impacts. It explores issues like data responsibility
and privacy, inclusion, moral agency, value alignment, accountability, and technology
misuse …to understand how to build and use AI in
ways that align with human ethics and expectations. There are five pillars for AI ethics: explainability, fairness, robustness, transparency, and privacy. These pillars are focus areas that help us
take action to build and use AI ethically. Explainability AI is explainable when it can show how and
why it arrived at a particular outcome or recommendation. You can think of explainability as an AI system
showing its work. Fairness AI is fair when it treats individuals or groups
equitably. AI can help humans make fairer choices by
counterbalancing human biases, but beware — bias can be present in AI too, so steps
must be taken to mitigate it. Robustness AI is robust when it can effectively handle
exceptional conditions, like abnormal input or adversarial attacks. Robust AI is built to withstand intentional
and unintentional interference. Transparency AI is transparent when appropriate information
is shared with humans about how the AI system was designed and developed. Transparency means that humans have access
to information like what data was used to train the AI system, how the system collects
and stores data, and who has access to the data the system collects. Privacy Because AI ingests so much data, it must be
designed to prioritize and safeguard humans' privacy and data rights. AI that is built to respect privacy collects
and stores only the minimum amount of data it needs to function, and collected data should never be repurposed
without users' consent, among other considerations. In summary, together, these five pillars — explainability, fairness, robustness, transparency, and privacy — help us to design, develop, deploy,
and use AI more ethically and to understand how to build and use
AI in ways that align with human ethics and expectations.Welcome to understanding
bias in AI. In this video, you will learn about bias in
the context of AI. You will find out how bias can emerge in AI, how bias
can impact AI's outcomes, and how to begin mitigating
potential bias in AI. So bias and artificial intelligence is
all about unwanted behaviors. Where AI systems that are used in
consequential decision making tasks, whether it's in lending,
hiring, even in criminal justice, gives systematic disadvantages to
certain groups and individuals. So an example would be an AI system
that's helping make decisions on who should receive extra
preventative healthcare and it gives more of that to white
people than black people. Or another example is
hiring algorithm where the AI system actually
gives more qualified men a chance to interview
than qualified women. There's actually many
sources of this happening. So when we talk about AI or machine
learning systems, they're trained on historical decisions that human
decision makers have made in the past. So because of that there's actually
the possibility that the human decision makers in the past were implicitly or
explicitly biased themselves and so that's reflected in the training
data through prejudice. Second is through
the sampling of the data. So it's possible that certain
groups are overrepresented or underrepresented in a particular data set. Another aspect that sometimes
overlooked is in the data processing or data preparation phase in
the data science project. So even the fact that I do some
feature engineering can lead to additional biases that might
not have been there before. So an example of that is coming
back to our healthcare example. So if I look at healthcare
costs separately as a feature. So inpatient, outpatient or emergency room, then there's much less bias that's
introduced against African Americans. Whereas if combine all of those
into a single feature is actually much more biased against
African Americans. And then there's also the question of
how am I even posing the problem itself? Maybe I'm predicting the wrong thing. So if I'm trying to predict
criminality where future crimes then arrests is not
a good way to look at that because the police arrest
people more often where they're more active in
certain neighborhoods and being arrested is not
the same as being guilty. So, as we talked about, there's many
sources of those biases and so we need to take actions that
help undo those sources. So one important aspect of it is even
recognizing that there are biases. So having a team of people who
have diverse lived experiences is one way to recognize those harms and other
sort of biases that might be in play. Another thing is to search for data sets that actually have
your your biases themselves. So that's another way
to counteract biases. And then finally,
there's technical approaches. So if we have a machine learning
model that we're training on data that is biased, we can actually
introduce extra constraints or other sort of statistical measures
in order to mitigate biases. So we've developed several
such algorithms and many of them are available in
the open source toolkit in AI fairness. Our goal is to ensure technology
makes a positive impact on society. I am proud to be a member
of the IBM AI Ethics Board to focus on conscious
inclusion through Good Tech. Our AI Ethics board represents
a cross section of diverse IBM-ers who address
in research eliminating bias while establishing
standards in this space. A few ways in which IBM-ers use AI and
data skills is by leveraging our technology to
develop assets to address bias. Also to address inclusive language in
tech terminology. This is around our
Language Matters initiative. And to ensure testing of our solutions
to decrease the probability and minimize the potential for bias. In D & I, we use AI and data analytics and
insights to inform decision support and address as well as minimize
the potential for bias. In HR, this means enhancing decision support
that can inform pay and retention, hiring and
promotion decisions. Using AI and data insights plays an important role to
assist in our compliance requirements and proactive actions that
we take around the globe.Machine Learning, a subset of AI, uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it has learned. Instead of following rules-based algorithms, machine learning builds models to classify and make predictions from data. Let's understand this by exploring a problem we may be able to tackle with Machine Learning. What if we want to determine whether a heart can fail, is this something we can solve with Machine Learning? The answer is, Yes. Let's say we are given data such as beats per minute, body mass index, age, sex, and the result whether the heart has failed or not. With Machine Learning given this dataset, we are able to learn and create a model that given inputs, will predict results. So what is the difference between this and using statistical analysis to create an algorithm? An algorithm is a mathematical technique. With traditional programming, we take data and rules, and use these to develop an algorithm that will give us an answer. In the previous example, if we were using a traditional algorithm, we would take the data such as beats per minute and BMI, and use this data to create an algorithm that will determine whether the heart will fail or not. Essentially, it would be an if-then-else statement. When we submit inputs, we get answers based on what the algorithm we determined is, and this algorithm will not change. Machine Learning, on the other hand, takes data and answers and creates the algorithm. Instead of getting answers in the end, we already have the answers. What we get is a set of rules that determine what the machine learning model will be. The model determines the rules, and the if-then-else statement when it gets the inputs. Essentially, what the model does is determine what the parameters are in a traditional algorithm, and instead of deciding arbitrarily that beats per minute plus BMI equals a certain result, we use the model to determine what the logic will be. This model, unlike a traditional algorithm, can be continuously trained and be used in the future to predict values. Machine Learning relies on defining behavioral rules by examining and comparing large datasets to find common patterns. For instance, we can provide a machine learning program with a large volume of pictures of birds and train the model to return the label "bird" whenever it has provided a picture of a bird. We can also create a label for "cat" and provide pictures of cats to train on. When the machine model is shown a picture of a cat or a bird, it will label the picture with some level of confidence. This type of Machine Learning is called Supervised Learning, where an algorithm is trained on human-labeled data. The more samples you provide a supervised learning algorithm, the more precise it becomes in classifying new data. Unsupervised Learning, another type of machine language, relies on giving the algorithm unlabeled data and letting it find patterns by itself. You provide the input but not labels, and let the machine infer qualities that algorithm ingests unlabeled data, draws inferences, and finds patterns. This type of learning can be useful for clustering data, where data is grouped according to how similar it is to its neighbors and dissimilar to everything else. Once the data is clustered, different techniques can be used to explore that data and look for patterns. For instance, you provide a machine learning algorithm with a constant stream of network traffic and let it independently learn the baseline, normal network activity, as well as the outlier and possibly malicious behavior happening on the network. The third type of machine learning algorithm, Reinforcement Learning, relies on providing a machine learning algorithm with a set of rules and constraints, and letting it learn how to achieve its goals. You define the state, the desired goal, allowed actions, and constraints. The algorithm figures out how to achieve the goal by trying different combinations of allowed actions, and is rewarded or punished depending on whether the decision was a good one. The algorithm tries its best to maximize its rewards within the constraints provided. You could use Reinforcement Learning to teach a machine to play chess or navigate an obstacle course. A machine learning model is a algorithm used to find patterns in the data  without the programmer having  to explicitly program these patterns.(Music) So what advice would
you give to someone who's looking to get
into a career in AI. Yes absolutely. I had
a bit of an unusual route becoming a data scientist or
an AI specialists myself. I have a background in psychology
so when I was studying, I was basically thinking
of continuing to do academic research and
not going to industry. But at some point in
time, I had a realization that I didn't really want
to become a professor. I didn't really want to teach or do research in
an academic setting. I started looking for
jobs and it was quite difficult because what we see today is sometimes what you'll learn in
university doesn't translate directly into
what companies want. So how do you bridge
that gap exactly? For me, when I was at the time
still in Tokyo, Japan, I didn't have a lot of
resources around me or English speaking resources at the time where I could
develop my skills. So I looked towards
online courses and online courses helped me
practice python, practice R, my data analysis skills through programming and I was able to develop a foundation
in the skill set that was highly sought after by
many different companies. Then from there,
the question became, okay, now I have these skills, these newly developed
skills through these courses that
I've taken online, how do I translate that
to something that I can show and demonstrate to
potential employers? So then the next problem I
had to deal with was, well, how do I demonstrate
that some way? So I created a portfolio of different online
assignment exercises projects to demonstrate that I could do the kinds of
things that they were hoping that I could do to
show my competency. I also when I came back
to Toronto, Canada, I started doing meet ups to
teach at these meet ups, teach R, teach Python,
teach data science. Again, further demonstrate my competencies so that
people could really see that I could do what I
was claiming that I could do. Which was a little bit
difficult because people would just look at
my resume and you see, oh, you have a background psychology, what does that have to do
with data science or AI? So it was hard in
that sense that had to overcome that burden of proof. The final piece of advice
that I would give is connect with fellow local AI specialists. Whether they are data scientists, specialists at
particular field of AI, machine learning researchers,
data engineers, just to get a better sense of what kind of AI
specialists you might be interested in becoming
because today there's so many different kinds
of AI specialists. You could be very technical. You could be doing research on the latest state-of-the-art
algorithms or you could be doing
something a bit more business-oriented, like trying to optimize revenue, maybe some reporting as well. Trying to find ways
to personalize a particular service to each and every kind of user
that you might have. There's different aspects of
AI and I think it's really important to have some clarity into what kind of role and
what kind of job you want. The first step to do that
is to be able to reach out and ask questions to people, who are
already in the field. It's a great way to get a sense
and also maybe even form some connections that
might be meaningful in your career as well. Those
are the four things. Number one is, acquire
skills, wherever you can. Always be open to learning
new things and new skills. Number two is demonstrate your capabilities through
projects, exercises. Something that you
can share online. Even blog posts and articles. Number three, if you can
teach at meet ups or maybe even more ideally
conferences, so you can demonstrate your
competencies in public. Then number four is going to be try to connect with
local experts or local specialists who are already in the field
so you can get a better sense,
what that career kind of road map might
look like for you. (Music)(Music) Before we deep dive
into how AI works, and its various use
cases and applications, let's differentiate some of
the closely related terms and concepts of AI:
artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning,
and neural networks. These terms are sometimes
used interchangeably, but they do not refer
to the same thing. Artificial intelligence
is a branch of computer science dealing with a simulation of
intelligent behavior. AI systems will typically demonstrate
behaviors associated with human intelligence such as planning, learning, reasoning, problem-solving,
knowledge representation, perception, motion, and manipulation, and to a lesser extent social
intelligence and creativity. Machine learning is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based
on what it has learned, without being
explicitly programmed. Machine learning algorithms
are trained with large sets of data and
they learn from examples. They do not follow
rules-based algorithms. Machine learning is what enables machines to solve
problems on their own and make accurate predictions using the provided data. Deep learning is
a specialized subset of Machine Learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate
human decision-making. Deep learning algorithms
can label and categorize information
and identify patterns. It is what enables AI systems to continuously learn on the job, and improve the quality
and accuracy of results by determining whether
decisions were correct. Artificial neural networks
often referred to simply as neural networks take inspiration from biological neural networks, although they work
quite a bit differently. A neural network in AI is a collection of
small computing units called neurons that take incoming data and learn to make
decisions over time. Neural networks are often
layered deep and are the reason deep learning
algorithms become more efficient as the datasets
increase in volume, as opposed to other machine
learning algorithms that may plateau
as data increases. Now that you have
a broad understanding of the differences between
some key AI concepts, there is one more differentiation that is important to understand, that between artificial
intelligence and data science. Data science is the process
and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data. It's an interdisciplinary field
involving mathematics, statistical analysis,
data visualization, machine learning, and more. It's what makes it
possible for us to appropriate information,
see patterns, find meaning from
large volumes of data, and use it to make decisions
that drive business. Data Science can use many of the AI techniques to
derive insight from data. For example, it could use
machine learning algorithms and even deep learning
models to extract meaning and draw
inferences from data. There is some intersection
between AI and data science, but one is not
a subset of the other. Rather, data science
is a broad term that encompasses the entire data
processing methodology. Well, AI includes everything
that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make
intelligent decisions. Both AI and Data Science
can involve the use of big data that is significantly
large volumes of data. In the next few lessons, the terms machine learning, deep learning, and
neural networks will be discussed in more detail. (Music)(Music) I remember that morning going to
the lab and I was thinking this is it, this is the last Jeopardy game.
It became real to me when the music played and Johnny Gilbert said
from IBM Research in Yorktown Heights, New York, this is Jeopardy and I just went.
Hear it is one day. This is the culmination of all this work.
To be honest with you I was emotional. Watson.
What is Shoe? You are right.
We actually took the lead. We were ahead of them,
but then we start getting some questions wrong. Watson?
What is Leg? No, I'm sorry. I can't accept that.
What is 1920's? No.
What is Chic? No, sorry, Brad.
What is Class? Class.
You got it. Watson. What is Sauron?
Sauron is right and that puts you into a tie for the lead with Brad.
The double Jeopardy round of the first game I thought was phenomenal.
Watson went on a terror. Watson, who is Franz List?
You are right. What is Violin?
Who is the Church Lady? Yes. Watson.
What is Narcolepsy? You are right and with that you move to $36,681.
Now, we come to Watson. Who is Bram Stoker and the wager, hello
$17,973 and a two day total of $77,147. We won Jeopardy.
They are very justifiably proud of what they've done.
I would've thought that technology like this was years away
but it's here now. I have the bruised ego to prove it.
I think we saw something important today. Wow, wait a second. This is history.
The 60th Annual Grammy Awards, powered by IBM Watson.
There's a tremendous amount of unstructured data
that we process on Grammy Sunday. Our partnership with the recording Academy
really is focused on helping them with some of
their workflows for their digital production. My content team is responsible not
only for taking all this raw stuff that's coming in,
but curating it and publishing it. You're talking about five hours of
red carpet coverage with 5,000 artists, making that trip down the carpet
with a 100,000 photos being shot. For the last five hours,
Watson has been using AI to analyze the colors, patterns, and silhouettes of
every single outfit that has passed through. So we've been able to see all the dominant
styles and compare them to Grammy shows in the past.
Watson's also analyzing the emotions of Grammy nominated song lyrics over the last
60 years. Get this, it can actually identify
the emotional themes in music and categorize them as joy,
sadness, and everything else in between. It's very cool.
Fantasy sports are an incredibly important and fun way that we serve sports
fans. Our fantasy games drive
tremendous consumption across ESPN digital properties,
and they drive tune-in to our events and studio shows.
But our users have a lot of different ways they can spend their time.
So we have to continuously improve our game so they choose to spend that time with us.
This year, ESPN teamed up with IBM to add a powerful new feature
to their fantasy football platform. Fantasy football generates a huge volume of
content - articles, blogs, videos, podcasts.
We call it unstructured data - data that doesn't fit neatly
into spreadsheets or databases. Watson was built to analyze that kind of
information and turn it into usable insights. We train Watson on millions of fantasy football
stories, blog posts, and videos.
We taught it to develop a scoring range for thousands of players,
their upsides and their downsides, and we taught it to estimate the chances of
player will exceed their upside or fall below the downside.
Watson even assesses a player's media buzz and their likelihood to play.
This is a big win for our fantasy football players.
It's one more tool to help them decide which running back or QB to start each week.
It's a great complement to the award-winning analysts our fans rely on.
As with any Machine Learning, the system gets smarter all the time.
That means the insights are better, which means are you just can make better decisions
and have a better chance to win their matchup every week.
The more successful our fantasy players are, the more time they'll spend with us.
The ESPN and IBM partnership is a great vehicle to demonstrate
the power of enterprise-grade AI to millions of people,
and it's not hard to see how the same technology applies to real life.
There are thousands of business scenarios where
you're assessing value and making trade-offs. This is what the future of
decision-making is going to look like. Man and machine working together,
assessing risk and reward, working through difficult decisions.
This is the same technology IBM uses to help doctors mine millions of
pages of medical research and investment banks fund market moving insights. (Music)

AI governance is and what it accomplishes, what ESG is and what it accomplishes, and how governance and
ESG connect to AI ethics? Governance is the organization's act
of governing through its corporate instructions, staff, its processes and
systems to direct, evaluate, and monitor, and to take corrective
action throughout the AI lifecycle to provide assurance that an AI system
is operating as an organization intends it to, and as stakeholders expected to, and
as may be required by relevant regulation. The objective of governance is to
deliver trustworthy AI by establishing requirements for accountability,
responsibility and oversight. Governance provides many benefits,
including, for example, trust. When AI activities
are aligned with values organizations can build systems
that are transparent, fair and trustworthy, boosting client
satisfaction and brand reputation. Another benefit is efficiency, when AI
activities are standardized and optimized development can happen with greater
efficiency, accelerating time to market. And compliance, when AI activities
are already managed and monitored, adjusting them to align with new and
forthcoming industry regulations and legal requirements is
really less cumbersome. The successful governance program takes
into account people, processes, and tools. It clearly defines the roles and responsibilities of people,
in building and managing trustworthy AI, including leaders who will set
policies and establish accountability. It establishes processes, for building, managing, monitoring and
communicating about AI. And it leverages tools to
gain greater visibility and consistency into AI system performance
throughout the AI lifecycle. ESG stands for
environmental social governance, and these are factors that are used to
measure all non financial risks and opportunities at companies. At IBM, that translates into IBM impact,
our strategy and philosophy on ESG. IBM impact is comprised of three pillars, that we believe will create
a more sustainable future. These pillars are environmental impact,
equitable impact, and ethical impact. And we accomplish this by making
a lasting positive impact, in the world in business ethics,
our environment, and in the communities in which we work and
live. The governance aspect of ESG
pertains to creating innovations, policies and
practices that prioritize ethics, trust, transparency and
above all accountability. And AI ethics is a significant aspect
of our governance initiatives. For example,
in 2022 we're aiming to reach 1,000 ecosystem partners trained in tech ethics. This goal matters because we
believe the benefits of AI, should touch the many and
not just the few. And developing a culture of
trustworthy AI must happen everywhere, not just within IBM. We're leading the way in AI ethics as we
aspire to create a more ethical future. [MUSIC](Music) So, can you talk
about advice for people who want to get into AI,
especially the teenagers like you or other students were fascinated by technology
and AI. So really what I believe, first of all,
is I mean I've seen a lot of misconceptions about AI, really wherever I
go. Whenever people ask me,
"How can I get into the field of machine learning or AI?"
There are lots of misconceptions, they feel like machine learning has its own
independent, isolated subject, and if I learn it,
I can go ahead and implement machine learning algorithms with these things.
But really if you think about it, machine learning is just another algorithm
in the toolbox of algorithms, when it comes to
programming. Albeit in some cases, it can be
much more powerful than other algorithms, and then on a very fundamental level,
it is another algorithm. So before you get into the field of machine
learning, before you get into the field of AI,
it's very important that you understand how to code.
Since machine learning is relatively complex technology,
having a very advanced knowledge of how computers work; how exactly coding works.
Then even sometimes a back-ends behind compilers, really does help you on your journey of
learning how to code machine learning algorithms. The reason I say this is because machine learning
isn't just a regular algorithm that you implement, its not just path finding
or search or something of that sort. It's special because it
requires intense hardware acceleration. It requires you to understand
at least a little bit of the calculus that goes behind backpropagation.
All of this is necessary to understand the fundamental workings of machine learning
and AI. So really to summarize
what I'd recommend is first of all, you should be passionate about technology
itself. If you're not passionate about
technology, machine learning technology, it really isn't something that you should
go and work towards. Then from there, once you know that you're
passionate about it, you want to do it. Then go ahead and start off by
learning concepts in the field of technology. Learn how to code in languages like Python,
Julia as a new language, SWIFT because of the new SWIFT for TensorFlow
project. Then from there, go ahead and learn a little
bit at least of the actual math behind neural networks.
I mean, I remember when I stumbled upon Watson, that was the first time I ever heard of machine
learning. When I went from Watson to custom neural networks,
the first thing I did is I actually drew a small neural network on paper,
and in the backpropagation, manually to understand how exactly weights
are updated, how a loss values work, all these sorts of
things. Once you have that fundamental understanding,
then you go ahead to implement those neural networks from scratch and your
languages. Then once you have
a good idea of how it works, once you practice. Once you learn by example,
then you're finally ready to go ahead and use different libraries,
use different toolkits to enable you to rapidly prototype and build applications
in the field of machine learning. So that's a very very high level view point,
that I'd say to get into machine learning, but of course,
there are better ways and more intuitive ways to get into machine learning
as well. For example, Watson, if you take a look at
how it provides its APIs on the cloud,
you don't need to understand any of the workings behind machine learning to use
Watson, and at the same time,
you can still leverage all those powerful capabilities,
the language translator. Lets you use practically state of the art,
neural machine translation techniques, and even train your own models without having
to understand a single clue
behind what goes behind the models. So being able to start off with a toolkit
like Watson, getting a good idea of
both programming and machine learning at once, what machine learning is and isn't capable
of. Then getting to the custom math, is another
great way. (Music)(Music) My latest poll of top cities for AI,
which is primarily myself just looking at what's coming through my own inbox in
terms of opportunities, it's fairly widespread. Actually there are a lot of opportunities
in a lot of different places. So there's of course the San Francisco Bay
area, which continues to be a hotbed for
startups in AI and robotics, and I think will continue to develop,
there's Boston in the United States which also
has a large number of startups, there's Seattle. Then here in Canada,
we've been doing a great job in both Toronto and Montreal,
of actually developing quite a robust and thriving AI ecosystem
that I think is going to also continue to develop and grow.
So I think we're quite excited about that. Then farther afield there
are a number of locations in Europe, Asia, some opportunities in China certainly,
China and India as well, absolutely. So if you're located
somewhere next to a major city center, I think in any of these areas,
you're well-positioned to to launch your AI career.
Toronto is exploding. It's been amazing to watch and be a part of.
We have Geoffrey Hinton obviously one of the three pillars
of the Turing Award for major contributions in deep learning,
and the whole Vector Institute and ecosystem has come up
around the wonderful progress that came out of
the University of Toronto over the last few decades.
So what we're seeing is wonderful incubators and startups in the area,
investing heavily in AI technology and capabilities, we're seeing large companies bringing in research
labs and putting those right next to the university,
and we're seeing a wonderful amount of funding coming in for research
specifically in AI in Toronto. So I think we're competitive with any of
the best places to learn and work on AI, in the world.
I think Canada is actually doing very well. We've done an excellent job overall in terms
of centralizing some really fantastic AI talents. So in Toronto and Montreal in
particular and also in Vancouver, but Vancouver, Edmonton,
a number of different cities in Canada, have really become very strong AI centers.
They continue to grow and we're attracting a lot of great AI talents,
and I believe that will just continue. So Canada is shaping up to be
a great place to come and do AI research and work in AI. (Music)[MUSIC] Welcome to AI ethics and regulations. In this video, you will learn
about what an AI regulation is, how AI regulations connect with AI ethics, and why it's important to understand
AI regulations if you work with AI. A regulation is a government
rule enforceable by law. The landscape of regulations
around AI is evolving rapidly. And it's important to understand key
pieces of regulation in order to design, develop, and deploy, and
use AI legally and ethically. IBM's position is that we call for precision regulation of
artificial intelligence. And we support targeted policies that
would increase the responsibilities for companies to develop and
operate trustworthy AI. Precision regulation of AI, refers to a regulation that aims to
be risk-based, context specific, and which allocates responsibility to
the party that is closest to the risk, which might shift throughout
the AI lifecycle. Specifically,
IBM has proposed a precision regulation framework that incorporates
five policy imperatives for organizations that provide and
or use AI systems. First, designate an AI ethics official,
a lead official responsible for compliance with trustworthy AI. Develop different rules for
different risks. In other words, regulate AI in
context not the technology itself. Don't hide your AI make it transparent. Explain your AI. So, in other words, make it
explainable not a black box decision. And test your AI for bias. [SOUND](Music) AI is at the forefront of a new era
of computing, Cognitive Computing. It's a radically new kind of computing,
very different from the programmable systems that
preceded it, as different as those systems were from the tabulating machines of a century
ago. Conventional computing solutions, based on
the mathematical principles that emanate from the 1940's,
are programmed based on rules and logic intended to derive mathematically precise
answers, often following a rigid decision tree approach.
But with today's wealth of big data and the need for more complex evidence-based decisions,
such a rigid approach often breaks or fails to keep up with available information.
Cognitive Computing enables people to create a profoundly new kind of value,
finding answers and insights locked away in volumes of data.
Whether we consider a doctor diagnosing a patient,
a wealth manager advising a client on their retirement portfolio,
or even a chef creating a new recipe, they need new approaches to
put into context the volume of information they deal with on
a daily basis in order to derive value from it.
These processes serve to enhance human expertise. Cognitive Computing mirrors some of
the key cognitive elements of human expertise, systems that reason about problems like a
human does. When we as humans seek to
understand something and to make a decision, we go through four key steps.
First, we observe visible phenomena and bodies of evidence.
Second, we draw on what we know to interpret what we
are seeing to generate hypotheses about what it means.
Third, we evaluate which hypotheses are right or wrong.
Finally, we decide, choosing the option that seems best and acting accordingly.
Just as humans become experts by going through the process of observation,
evaluation, and decision-making, cognitive systems use similar processes
to reason about the information they read, and they can do this at massive speed and
scale. Unlike conventional computing solutions,
which can only handle neatly organized structured data
such as what is stored in a database, cognitive computing solutions can
understand unstructured data, which is 80 percent of data today.
All of the information that is produced primarily by humans for other humans to consume.
This includes everything from literature, articles,
research reports to blogs, posts, and tweets. While structured data is governed by
well-defined fields that contain well-specified information,
cognitive systems rely on natural language, which is governed by rules of
grammar, context, and culture. It is implicit, ambiguous,
complex, and a challenge to process. While all human language is difficult to parse,
certain idioms can be particularly challenging. In English for instance,
we can feel blue because it's raining cats and dogs,
while we're filling in a form, someone asked us to fill out.
Cognitive systems read and interpret text like a person.
They do this by breaking down a sentence grammatically, relationally,
and structurally, discerning meaning from the semantics of the written material.
Cognitive systems understand context. This is very different from simple speech
recognition, which is how a computer translates
human speech into a set of words. Cognitive systems try to understand
the real intent of the users language, and use that understanding to draw inferences
through a broad array of linguistic models and algorithms.
Cognitive systems learn, adapt, and keep getting smarter.
They do this by learning from their interactions with us,
and from their own successes and failures, just like humans do.(Music) The original AI researchers were very interested in games because they were extremely complex.
Huge numbers of possible positions and gains were available,
yet they're simple in a certain way. They're simple in that the moves are well-defined,
the goals are well-defined. So you don't have to solve everything all
at once. With chess in particular,
in the work on Deep Blue at IBM, what became apparent,
what computers could do on our problem like that was bringing
a massive amount of compute resource to do deeper searches,
to investigate more options of moves in chess than was previously possible.
Watson defeating jeopardy. So this was another crossover point,
in the development of AI and cognitive computing. That the questions that IBM was able to answer
with jeopardy were questions that weren't
simply looking up in the database, and finding the answer somewhere.
Rather it required information retrieval over lots of different information resources.
Then the combining of these together using machine learning that could
arrive at answers that went beyond what was simply written somewhere.
Now, our technology is so much better and so much more advanced that we're
really ready to move on and to tackle much more challenging problems that
have this ill-defined or messy nature. Every industry from oil and gas,
to healthcare, to media and entertainment, to retail are just being
swamped by a tsunami of unstructured data. That can be multimedia,
can be images, it can be video, it can be text.
It's really the ability to understand that data that is becoming critical.
One of the most valuable applications of cognitive computing is in the health domain.
Medical providers, physicians, nurses, assistants face enormous challenges,
leveraging all of the available information that's out there.
The medical literature increases by about 700,000 articles every year.
There's already millions of journal articles out there,
and today's imaging technologies produce very rich amount of information.
In fact, a particular scan might have 5,000 images in it.
You combine the image analysis with natural language understanding,
and text analysis, leveraging the medical literature,
leveraging the patient's medical history, the physician has got a lot
more information and knowledge at their disposal to help them
make the best diagnosis possible. Clearly, there is intersection
of what the computer can do and what people are able to do.
That gives you something that's better than each of them individually.
What is going to be truly interesting is to see what is
the best way for them to have really symbiotic type of interaction,
taking advantage of each other's strengths to collectively solve a problem?
Watson, it looks at another aspect of intelligence, and a much more difficult aspect
of intelligence, that is language. You have to be able to interpret
the questions and come up with the right answers no matter what the topic.
So I think the ideal scenario for AI in the modern world
is not to try and develop a system that completely autonomously
handled every aspect of a problem, but have a collaboration
between machines doing what they do best and people doing what they do
best. I can imagine that combination will do
better than either one by themselves. We're constantly here looking for
what's the next grand challenge problem we can take on?
That's not just around the corner or a year away,
but it's going to take a multi-year effort. When we get there, we'll have something
that's valuable for the world. (Music)[MUSIC] What does AI have in store for
us in the future? >> My crystal ball is a little cloudy, so I don't know if I have a prediction
that I would bet money on. What I do know is,
what we have seen is the way AI has progressed, it starts fairly slowly, but then it gains steam exponentially. One good example is, DeepMind put the system together
that won in the game of Go. It's a 2,500-year-old game,
which won against a human opponent. But what's most amazing is while
the first system was able to out do 2,500 years of human history in the game,
the second generation of that system was able to outplay the first generation
of the system in less than one year. And it only took about
40 hours of training for it to be able to achieve that
level of proficiency in that game. And it won 100 games out of 100. So what we do know is the pace
of which this technology is accelerating is just breathtaking. And it's not something we
can predict very well. So if there was one prediction I were
to make it's, it's going to get faster, it's going to get better,
it's going to get cheaper, and it is going to happen very, very rapidly
within a very short period of time. >> It's going to be an interesting world. It's going to evolve very rapidly. Because these technologies not only can
perform tasks that we've never seen automated before, but learn as they
do them and continue to improve. So what we'll see is
we'll deploy systems and every year they'll get incrementally
better at the tasks they're trying to do. So we won't have to drive
our own cars anymore. Hopefully, we won't have
to put away our own dishes. There'll be a lot of simple things in
our lives that become automated and become eliminated from
our daily task list. It's a revolution that
we've been through before. The first washing machines,
the first dishwashers, etc. All these things that helped us,
enriched our lives and simplified the way we live and
increased our comfort. And I think we'll see many
more such evolutions as we watch the AI world unfold. >> Particularly in healthcare,
I think we'll see faster recovery times, we'll see better patient outcomes,
we'll see people spending less money and time in hospitals and
in various care centers. AI has been game changing for healthcare. There's so much information that we can
take out of a particular system and apply it to another. >> We can build all sorts of
models that can be hugely beneficial to long-term care. So that's something that I'm very
excited about and seeing that evolve. >> Looking into the crystal ball,
I'm always apprehensive to make long-term predictions, but my hope is that we are
able to indeed deploy these collaborative robotic systems, including self-driving
cars, to make people's live better. That's the idea, is to use AI and
robotics technology to improve the quality of life for
the whole spectrum of society. So I would be looking forward
to a future in which AI plays a central role in freeing us
from the dull, the mundane, the dirty, the dangerous jobs, and hopefully providing us with more
time to spend with our families. Better health, potentially,
better healthcare through data analysis. And so I think if envision
the future that I hope for will come to pass in a number of years, we'll be really leveraging these
technologies to make our lives better and to free ourselves from dull,
dirty, dangerous work. [MUSIC]Can you give Can you give
some specific examples of applications of AI? Certainly. So we have a fairly large collaborative
robotics program. So the cobots we work on are primarily targeted
at the moment at manufacturing applications, manufacturing,
warehousing, logistics, these types of applications
where normally you may have a person doing a job
that can be dull, it can be dangerous, and having robotic support or having a robot actually do the job may make it much safer, more efficient, and
more effective overall. So we work on a lot of
those types of applications, particularly where
the robots are trying to interface directly
with people, as I said. So the robot may help an individual to
lift a heavy container, or help to move
items on a stocking, on a shelf stocking purposes, so all these kinds
of applications, where I think we'll see
collaborative robots move first, and then hopefully one day and maybe into your home
to help you with the laundry and dishes in
the kitchen. Hopefully. For example, in oil and
gas, there's a company, a pretty large oil
and gas company called the Abu Dhabi
National Oil Company, and one of the problems that any kind of oil company
has to deal with is, where's the best place for
them to drill for oil? So they have to find these rock samples of
all these different places, for this place and in
this place, and that place, and maybe hundreds of different places for
them to drill oil. From these rock samples, now you have
all these fine sheets of rock in maybe hundreds
or thousands of them, and it's up to these oil
companies to be able to classify these using they're trained
and expert geologists. But to train
geologists to properly classify these sheets of
rock can be quite difficult, it could be time-consuming, could cost a lot
of money as well. So one way to help augment the capabilities of humans is to be able to use
computer vision, to classify these rocks
samples to be able to identify which of
these locations are the best to drill for oil? That's in oil and gas. Imagine before this,
if there was a very, very rare form of cancer experienced by a doctor in Dubai, and if there were
another case in New Zealand, how do you think they would have actually figured out that, "Hey, we're both dealing with this very rare case since we
work together." That wouldn't have been
possible in the past, but now with machine
learning technology being able to aggregate
knowledge from so many different sources into one centralized Cloud
and understand it, and provide that information inaccessible, intuitive,
implicit way. Now, that New Zealand doctor
can actually go ahead and use this machine learning technique to say, "Hey, just a few days ago there was a doctor with a very similar case," even though it may
not be the exact same thing. Sure. So we work with a number of startups and the number
of enterprises, and I'll just bring
a couple of examples. So what they like to
talk quite a bit about is company out in California
called Echo Devices. What they've done
is they've taken a simple device which
is stethoscope, something we see around
the neck of every physician, nurse, and the health
care professional, and they taken that device and basically have transformed
that into first, into a digital device by cutting
the tube on stethoscope, inserting a digitizer into it
that takes an analog sound, transforms it into
a digital signal, amplifies it in the process, makes it a lot easier
for people to hear, it's amplified sound,
the sound of your heart, or your lungs working. But what it also allows us to do is that allows us to take the digital signal and sent it via Bluetooth to a smart phone. Once it's on a smart phone, they're able to graph it, which allows the physician
to better understand, not just through audio data but through an actual graph of
how your heart is working. But because the information is now captured in
the digital world, it can now be central
machine-learning algorithm, and that's what they do. A machine-learning algorithm can actually learn from that, apply your previous learnings
from the human doctors, cardiologist, and now assist a physician who is using the device in
their current diagnosis. So it basically not replacing a physician in
any way, shape, or form, it is assistive technology
which is taking the learnings of the previous generations
of human cardiologist, and helping in the diagnosis
in the current state. To me, that's a perfect example
of taking the X, which is in this particular case
as a stethoscope, and then adding AI to that X. I have a really nifty
name for that, they call it Shazam
for Heartbeats. (Music)[MUSIC] What advice would you give to
someone who wants to learn AI, or perhaps even get into a career in AI? >> So I believe artificial intelligence
is going to permeate every sphere of human endeavor. So the first thing I would say is
I would congratulate the person who've chosen to study and
apply AI as having made the right choice. The second part I would say is because
the technology is moving so fast, because we have not yet
discovered what we're going to discover, I think it's really important
to keep an open mind. It's important to keep an open mind and
not get too attached to any particular technology, any particular technique,
any particular implementation. But to really think forward and think outside of the box,
and think about what may, think about the art of the possible,
think about what may come. And the number one advice I would
give is apply what you learn. Don't make it academic, make it practice. >> The first thing I would say is take
a look at a great Coursera course, like this one, and grasp the basics of AI. Get a fundamental lay of the land and understand what is involved in
various types of AI systems. And perhaps find the niche that
you're most interested in. And then, of course,
look at academic programs that can help you to learn more about
that specific area. And for students who are coming up
through high school, for example, I would say definitely spend time
focusing on math and science. Certainly, all disciplines are valuable,
but your knowledge of mathematics and science will certainly pay off
when you're working on AI systems. Because there are tons
of opportunities and you'll need mathematics to really fully
understand how the AI systems operate. So take your mathematics and
your science seriously. And then look at Coursera and
then beyond to other educational programs that can give you the basis you need
to really jump into the industry. >> The field of AI has changed
a lot in the last five years. No longer require a PhD in some
kind of advanced mathematics or know some obscure programming language. You just have to know how to use the
software APIs and understand the problem. For example, you can use Watson, and you just have to understand the problem
and understand how the API works. But you still require some advance
knowledge if you would like to build your own algorithm. >> So artificial intelligence machine
learning, this is a very important field. It is the future of technology. Because it essentially opens up this whole
new world of interaction with computers. A world that so far,
we barely even knew existed. And it enables us to interact with
computers in an implicit way. But what I would say is that while
machine learning technology is important, it's not something that you
can learn in isolation. Machine learning technology is
not its own standalone subject. It's another algorithm in the toolbox
of a plethora of algorithms that programmers will use
in their applications, albeit a much more intelligent or
a much more powerful algorithm than most. But still, it's another algorithm. So before you learn machine
learning technology, it's very important to understand
the actual programming and the technology that goes behind
machine learning technology. Specifically because machine learning
actually requires this kind of next generation of programming,
hardware acceleration, so much more, that regular programming and regular
algorithms don't necessarily require. So I'd really recommend making sure that,
first of all, you are passionate about
technology itself. If you are, continue, learn about
programming, learn about coding, learn how to actually speak
the computer's language. Learn about the computational
thinking behind code. And then go ahead and learn about machine
learning from the very, very basics. Start off with an API like IBM Watson
to help you get an idea of what it's capable of. Then move on to more advanced, custom
techniques and the math behind them. >> So AI is a fascinating field. But it's built on a huge
number of foundational domains or foundational fields of study. So you really need to
know your mathematics, you really need to know your probability
statistics, your optimization. And you have to be able to program. You have to be able to take advantage of
the tools, that are out there to train these networks and
understand how they work. So AI is really a broad field that
requires a lot of specialists and a lot of specialization in a lot of areas. So one of the best things, you
can do is get started quickly. Start playing with some simple tasks. Try to identify digits or
try to find cats on Internet pictures, right, things like this. These are wonderful challenges, that can
get you going in understanding what you need to learn about that field. >> Getting into AI now, is like getting
into anything to do with Internet, 20, 30 years ago. It's kind of the Renascence
of software right now. It's possible now,
it wasn't possible ten years ago. We have the computing technology. We have the computing power. We have the knowledge. And this is a field that will only grow. So I think you need to get in yesterday. [MUSIC](Music) In a world of dramatic digital transformation, companies are looking to AI to really help them shape the future of work. AI can predict and inform future outcomes. It enables people to do higher value work and businesses to imagine new models. It can automate decisions, processes, experiences but AI is not magic. The truth is there is no AI without IA or information architecture, but many organizations can't start because 80% of their data is locked in silos and not business-ready. So, how do you turn your aspirations into outcomes? Through a prescriptive set of steps we call the ladder AI and it starts with modernizing all of your data on a single platform that runs on any cloud. Then on the ladder itself, there are four steps First, collect the data to make it simple and accessible Really think about the models you need to train Second, organize your data to create a business-ready analytics foundation for those AI models. Third, analyze your data both for trust and transparency Because there's no use in applying and scaling AI if you can't explain the outcome, detect bias or prove its accuracy Fourth, once you can really trust your data and the AI that you deploy Then you can realize its full value Inside of the apps and processes that control your everyday work. In other words, The last step is infuse or you begin to operationalize AI throughout your entire business We help thousands of enterprises put AI to work by unlocking the value of their data and this AI and multi-cloud world By delivering the right set of skills for their people and by building trust and transparency into AI. That's the ladder to AI in a nutshell. Let's start climbing. (Music)(Music) Can you talk about AI in action. To give an example of say machine learning in action today, how companies have
actually implemented it, there's one example that I
always love to go back to, and it is the example
of Woodside Energy, a company in the Australia
New Zealand region. Now originally, they actually contacted IBM because they wanted the IBM to be able to create essentially a system
that can understand the different documents and the research that they're
engineers come up with, and have Watson and
understand that, and essentially replace some of the engineers on their team. IBM actually went ahead and build the application
that worked to Watson was able to understand
that unstructured content, but they never ended up replacing
any of their engineers. Instead, they actually ended
up hiring more engineers, because now they realized
that two things. First of all, the barrier of entry for each engineer is now lower and knowledge can now be shared more effectively
among the teams. Because now instead of
research being written and put into an archive drawer where it's never seen again, Watson's ingesting that data, understanding it and providing
it to whoever needs it, whoever Watson thinks
would need that data. So if you imagine in
these TV shows and in these movie scenes as
well, you have sometimes, if someone's looking for
a particular suspect in this particular traffic
intersection or whatnot, if passed through
this intersection, and there's of course
some cameras around. So we have the
security guard maybe, trying to look through
hours and hours, dozens and hundreds
of hours of footage, maybe at 10x speed and find that particular black SUV
or that green car. Then as soon as they find it at the end of the episode
or whatnot, then say aha, we
found that person. But if you had some sort of
computer vision algorithm running on this video for
just the entire time, then you wouldn't have
a need for some person to have to manually watch through hours and
hours of footage. Our specific use case is actually triggering new neural pathways
in the brain to form. As you can imagine, there's a lot of information
that happens there between the connection of how your body functions and
how your brain functions, and what parts of
the brain are damage, what parts of the brain
aren't damaged, and how you're actually moving
the person or how you're triggering certain things
in the human body to happen in order for
new neural pathways to form. So what we've done is actually, we've created massive data sets of information of
how people move, and how that responds to
different areas of the brain. Through that information,
we're able to trigger specific movements
with a robotic device, which in turn creates these neural pathways
to form in the brain, and therefore
recovering the person who suffered
a neurological trauma. (Music)
