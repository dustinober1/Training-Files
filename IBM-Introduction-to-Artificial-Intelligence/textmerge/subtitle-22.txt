(Music) In a world of dramatic digital transformation, companies are looking to AI to really help them shape the future of work. AI can predict and inform future outcomes. It enables people to do higher value work and businesses to imagine new models. It can automate decisions, processes, experiences but AI is not magic. The truth is there is no AI without IA or information architecture, but many organizations can't start because 80% of their data is locked in silos and not business-ready. So, how do you turn your aspirations into outcomes? Through a prescriptive set of steps we call the ladder AI and it starts with modernizing all of your data on a single platform that runs on any cloud. Then on the ladder itself, there are four steps First, collect the data to make it simple and accessible Really think about the models you need to train Second, organize your data to create a business-ready analytics foundation for those AI models. Third, analyze your data both for trust and transparency Because there's no use in applying and scaling AI if you can't explain the outcome, detect bias or prove its accuracy Fourth, once you can really trust your data and the AI that you deploy Then you can realize its full value Inside of the apps and processes that control your everyday work. In other words, The last step is infuse or you begin to operationalize AI throughout your entire business We help thousands of enterprises put AI to work by unlocking the value of their data and this AI and multi-cloud world By delivering the right set of skills for their people and by building trust and transparency into AI. That's the ladder to AI in a nutshell. Let's start climbing. (Music)
