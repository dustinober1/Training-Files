## Week 3 Quiz
- Watson Studio includes an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that enables a non-programmer to speed up the model building process by visually selecting, configuring, designing and auto coding neural networks. 
- To help you get started, Watson Machine Learning comes with a wide range of pretrained models and open datasets.
- Watson knowledge catalog can connect to a diverse set of data sources including RDBMS, NoSQL, file systems, and Hadoop so you can access the information wherever it exists.
- Alexnet was the first neural network which used backpropagation with a convolutional neural network. Alexnet beat all other competitors in the Image.net challenge in 2012.
- Watson Visual Recognition can detect human faces and identify qualities such as gender and age of facial features.
- Watson Personality Insights uses social listening to detect an individual’s personality characteristics. Using this information, your organization can tailor communication for each individual based on their personality, on their needs and their values. 
- Watson Tone Analyzer can be used to measure the performance of your customer service agents, allowing you to monitor the reactions of your customers to provide better quality service. You can use it to escalate customer conversations when they turn sour or find opportunities to improve customer service scripts, dialog strategies, and customer journeys.
- Watson OpenScale includes NeuNetS, short for neural network synthesis, which can quickly and automatically build models from your latest data while recommending new models to be applied across your business.
- Watson Compare and Comply does not compare a document with custom grammatical models and ensure that they are in compliance.
- When you use you data with any Watson service, that data remains completely in your control.
### Graded: More Watson AI Services
- Watson Studio’s built-in Neural Network Modeler helps you build models with a simplified graphical interface.
- Watson Machine Learning is a set of REST APIs that you can call from any programming language to develop applications that make smarter decisions, solve tough problems, and improve user outcomes.
- Watson Knowledge Catalog active policy enforcement capabilities support automatic and dynamic masking of sensitive data elements.  
- Although you can train Watson Visual Recognition with your own custom image data, it only comes with several pre-trained models. 
- Watson Visual Recognition has the ability to build custom models to recognize images specific to your domain, which will allow you to train it to recognize malformed widgets.
- There's no training required to use the Personality Insights Service. Out of the box, it's ready to go at recognizing your customer's personality types, needs and values. 
- Watson Tone Analyser allows you to monitor the reactions of your customers to provide them better quality service. You can use it to escalate customer conversations if the customer gets angry and the customer service agent cannot calm the customer.
- Watson OpenScale is an open platform that gives businesses a clear accurate view of their AI systems helping them monitor, automate, and fine-tune performance across their lifecycle.
- Watson Compare and Comply identifies elements within documents in your company, and is especially useful for analysing the content of contracts. You can easily move between identified elements, for example, to find all the obligations related to the category of payment terms.
- Watson Tone Analyzer allows you to personalize marketing communications with clients, enabling you to most effectively communicate with clients based on their current emotional state.
