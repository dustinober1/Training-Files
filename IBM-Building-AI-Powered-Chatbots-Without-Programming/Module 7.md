# Module 7
- The "Found" section of a slot allow us to specify what to say to the user (e.g., thanking them) when they provide a valid reply to the slot.
- The "Not Found" section of a slot allow us to specify what to say to the user when they provide an invalid reply to the slot (e.g., a reply that doesn't meet the slot condition).
- Digressions allows us to decide what the chatbot should do when the user asks a different question instead of replying to the slot question.
- Handlers are executed first.
- We must explicitly enable returns to a slot to continue where we left off before a digression.
