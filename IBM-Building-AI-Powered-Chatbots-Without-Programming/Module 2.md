# Module 2
- English is the default, but you can choose among many languages.
- Intents start with an # symbol, unlike @entities and $context variables.
- A generous amount of examples will fine tune Watson's understanding of an intent. 5 is the recommended minimum.
- Intents recognize the intent expressed in a customer's input.
- Our examples train Watson on what a given intent might look like. This way, it can recognize when the user expresses the same intent in their own words.
