- In traditional programming, a programmer has to formulate or code rules manually, whereas, in Machine Learning, the algorithm automatically formulates the rules from the data.
- Labeling typically takes a set of unlabeled data and augments each piece of it with informative tags.
- In Keras, dense is used to define a layer of connected neurons.
- An optimization problem seeks to minimize a loss function.
- The optimizer figures out the next guess based on the loss function.
- The training takes place on the fit command.
- Convergence is when guesses get better and better closing to a 100% accuracy.
